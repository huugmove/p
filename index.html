				<p class="small">Gustav Elijah Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), known professionally as Lil Peep (often stylized as LiL PEEP), was an American rapper, singer, songwriter and model. He was a member of the emo rap collective GothBoiClique. Helping pioneer an emo revival style of rap and rock music, Lil Peep has been credited as the leading figure of the mid–late 2010s emo rap scene and came to be an inspiration to outcasts and youth subcultures</p>

				<p class="small">Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and raised on Long Island, New York, Lil Peep started releasing music on SoundCloud in 2014,using the pseudonym Lil Peep because his mother had called him "Peep" since he was a child. He soon became popular on the platform for his collaborations with Lil Tracy and several mixtapes: Lil Peep; Part One, Live Forever, Crybaby and Hellboy; the latter's success led him to his first solo tour across the United States</p>

Second album Come Over When ur Sober,Pt.2 was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number four on the Billboard. The documentary movie, Everybody's Everything, was released in 2019</p>
